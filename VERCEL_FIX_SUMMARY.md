# Vercel Deployment Fix - Rollup Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing due to a Rollup native module issue:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

This is a known npm bug related to optional dependencies in Rollup.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- **Downgraded Vite** from `^7.1.2` to `^5.4.0` for better stability
- **Downgraded @vitejs/plugin-react** from `^5.0.0` to `^4.3.0`
- **Added explicit Rollup** version `^4.21.0`
- **Added platform-specific Rollup package** `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc`

### 2. Enhanced Vite Configuration
- Added `external: []` to rollup options
- Added `global: 'globalThis'` definition
- Configured ESBuild as the minifier
- Set target to `esnext` for better compatibility

### 3. Improved Vercel Configuration
- **Removed custom builds configuration** that was causing issues
- **Added framework detection** with `"framework": "vite"`
- **Added explicit build commands** and output directory
- **Added install command** `npm ci` for cleaner installs
- **Kept routing configuration** for SPA support

### 4. Added Dependency Management
- **Created `.npmrc`** file to handle optional dependencies
- **Updated `.gitignore`** to exclude `package-lock.json` from version control

## Key Changes Made

### package.json
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.0",
    "vite": "^5.4.0",
    "rollup": "^4.21.0",
    "@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc": "^4.21.3"
  }
}
```

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm ci"
}
```

### .npmrc
```
optional=false
fund=false
audit=false
```

## Results
- ✅ Local build now succeeds without errors
- ✅ Dependencies are properly resolved
- ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub to trigger new Vercel deployment
- ✅ Vercel should now deploy successfully with the updated configuration

## What to Monitor
1. Check the new Vercel deployment for success
2. Verify the application loads correctly in production
3. Test routing and static asset serving

The deployment should now work correctly on Vercel's Linux environment.
